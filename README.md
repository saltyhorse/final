When traveling, many people want to explore the places that locals frequent and would recommend.
Current websites don't make it easy to find these spots. This MVP was centered around solving this issue 
and creating a place where people can explore local's favorite restaurants and how locals feel about them. 

The concept would be that people can create accounts and submit reviews for restaurants in their area. Vistors can
find a list of restaurants that locals like to frequent, read up on basic info about the restaurant, and see how locals would
rate the restaurant. This MVP focuses on just the Bay Area, though the full on product would feature other cities.
